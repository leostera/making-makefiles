                        Make was created a long time ago. It's been around since 1976.

                        Before Make there used to come bundled both `make` and `install` shell scripts
                        that would help building and installing the project.

                        Lastly, it's ultimate purpose was to abstract out dependency tracking, allow for
                        composability of targets, and handling of files/archives.
